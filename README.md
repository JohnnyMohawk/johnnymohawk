### Hi, I'm John Nelson-Alden! ðŸ‘‹

- I am a full-stack software developer with a passion for problem solving, organization, efficiency, and creativity. Having spent my early years working as a professional actor on screen and stage, my creative energy turned towards the culinary arts and I have logged two decades as a professional chef, working in some of the nationâ€™s finest restaurants. My unique experience has equipped me with tools to create efficient, real-world solutions to complex problems on-the-fly.
